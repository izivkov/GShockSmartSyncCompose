# G-Shock Smart Sync Compose

Welcome to the **G-Shock Smart Sync Compose** project! This project is currently in testing mode. It will replace [CasioGShockSmartSync](https://github.com/izivkov/CasioGShockSmartSync) upon completion. 
We aim to build a refined, user-friendly interface using Jetpack Compose to enhance the experience of syncing and managing G-Shock devices.

## Project Overview

G-Shock Smart Sync Compose is designed as a thin client for Android that enables seamless synchronization with Casio G-Shock watches. The project focuses on:
- Minimal, functional UI using Jetpack Compose.
- Direct data transfer to and from the watch without local storage (excluding user preferences).
- Reliable, offline-first operations with BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) for watch connection.
- Modular design to simplify testing and contributions.

## How to Help

We're excited to invite the community to help test this project. We want your feedback on functionality, usability, and any issues you encounter.
