/home/izivkov/projects/GShockSmartSyncCompose/api/src/main/java/org/avmedia/gshockapi/io/EventsIO.kt:97: Error: Call requires API level 35 (current min is 26): java.util.ArrayList#removeLast [NewApi]
                result.removeLast()
                       ~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "NewApi":
   This check scans through all the Android API calls in the application and
   warns about any calls that are not available on all versions targeted by
   this application (according to its minimum SDK attribute in the manifest).

   If you really want to use this API and don't need to support older devices
   just set the minSdkVersion in your build.gradle or AndroidManifest.xml
   files.

   If your code is deliberately accessing newer APIs, and you have ensured
   (e.g. with conditional execution) that this code will only ever be called
   on a supported platform, then you can annotate your class or method with
   the @TargetApi annotation specifying the local minimum SDK to apply, such
   as @TargetApi(11), such that this check considers 11 rather than your
   manifest file's minimum SDK as the required API level.

   If you are deliberately setting android: attributes in style definitions,
   make sure you place this in a values-vNN folder in order to avoid running
   into runtime conflicts on certain devices where manufacturers have added
   custom attributes whose ids conflict with the new ones on later platforms.

   Similarly, you can use tools:targetApi="11" in an XML file to indicate that
   the element will only be inflated in an adequate context.
